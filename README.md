# Introduction

The objective of this task is to analyze the relationship between GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and CO2 emissions and plot a well-known economic concept known as the Environmental Kuznets Curve. The Environmental Kuznets Curve suggests that environmental degradation initially increases with economic growth but eventually starts to decline as a country reaches a certain level of economic development and implements environmental policies.

# Tasks

- Data cleaning: filter rows, mutate columns, handling missing values, etc... 
- Plotting: The objective is to create a plot that effectively demonstrates the Environmental Kuznets Curve.
